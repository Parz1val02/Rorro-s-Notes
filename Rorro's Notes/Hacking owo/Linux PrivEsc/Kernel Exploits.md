#LinuxPrivEsc 
  
The kernel on Linux systems manages the communication between components such as the memory on the system and applications. This critical function requires the kernel to have specific privileges; thus, a successful exploit will potentially lead to root privileges

The Kernel exploit methodology is simple

1.  Identify the kernel version
2.  Search and find an exploit code for the kernel version of the target system
3.  Run the exploit

Although it looks simple,  a failed kernel exploit can lead to a system crash

Search with google, exploit-db or searchsploit
