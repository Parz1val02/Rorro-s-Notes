32 bit x86 processors -> 2^32 possible addresses in memory
64 bit x64 processors -> 2^48 possible addresses in memory
64 buit processors can ru in 32-bit compatiblity mode
_Registers:_ special variables found in processors

>Negative numbers are stored as 2's comlement: flip all the bytes and add 1

*objdump*
*gdb*

==General Purpose Registers==
|esp|ebp|esi|edi|
|---|---|---|---|
|Stack pointer|Base pointer|Source index|Destination index|
The first two registers are called pointers because they store 32-bit addresses, which essentially point to that location in memory.
The last two are also technically pointers, which are commonly used to point to the source and destination when data needs to be read from or written to.

_eip register:_ instruction pointer register, which points to the current instruction the pointer is reading

##### Assembly syntax: operation <destination> <source>

DWORD: 4 byte values
On x86 processors, values are stored in little-endian byte order, which means the less significant byte is stored first
gcc -g :includes extra debugging information to view with gdb
gdb -q

Gdb commands
x -> examine
print
nexti (next instruction)
The examine command also accepts the format letter i, instruction
The format letter c looks up a byte in the ASCII table
THe format letter s will display an entire string of character data
